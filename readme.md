# **Learning-by-Myself (LbM): Self-Supervised Learning in Biosignals and Biomedical image**
 

## **IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2024 (ICIP-2024)**

 

 

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is revolutionizing deep learning technologies by enabling the training of models without human-labeled data. In signal and image processing, cutting-edge systems rely on large Transformer neural networks pretrained on extensive signal/image datasets, using methods like contrastive or multitask learning. SSL is further explored in biosignals and medical image processing, dealing with diagnosis and disease prediction, leveraging unlabeled data to train models, reducing the need for manual annotation. This approach is transforming these fields by improving model performance and enabling the use of large, diverse datasets, leading to more accurate and efficient medical diagnostic and analysis tools.

 

Despite the surge in accepted articles mentioning SSL techniques in recent top-tier conferences, challenges hinder broader adoption in real-world applications. SSL models face complexity issues, lack a standardized evaluation protocol, exhibit biases and robustness concerns, and lack integration with related modalities like text or video.

 

The LbM workshop addresses these challenges by fostering interactions among experts. Through two keynotes, a panel, and paper presentations, LbM aims to unite the SSL community, including experts from various modalities, to frame SSL as a groundbreaking solution for biosignals and biomedical image processing and beyond. This workshop provides a dedicated platform for discussing and advancing SSL technologies, paving the way for their broader application in diverse fields.
